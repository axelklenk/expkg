# expkg: an example package for exploring and testing an S4 method dispatch issue


The `GSVA` package allows one to perform a change in coordinate systems of molecular measurements, transforming the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods such as functional enrichment, survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner. For citing `GSVA` as a software package, please use the following reference:
